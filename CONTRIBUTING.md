If you want to contribute to this list of resources, your pull requests are very welcome.

To add resources, follow these steps:

* fork the repository
* edit the `resources.csv`; you can do it with your preferred editor
* after you have saved the `resources.csv` file, generate a new version of the `README.md` with the command: `php csv2md.php resources.csv README.md`
* at this point you have both the `resources.csv` and `README.md` files changed; commit & push the files, summarizing what the commit does;
* once your fork is up to date, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

What type of content is appreciated:

* new useful resources that fit into the categories
* fixes or removal of resources that are no longer available at current URL

Notes:

* try to avoid to add commercial extensions; limit to very useful and popular (possibly free) tools/extensions;
* if you think a reorganization of contents/categories is needed, let's discuss it together
